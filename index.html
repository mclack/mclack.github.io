				<h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
				<p>My journey in this corporeal dimension began on July the 8th 1998. I was born in the city of Oxford and lived there until I was 15, which is when I ended up moving to Waterlooville for a couple of years. By this point I became very demotivated and actually ended up dropping out of my A-Levels before moving on to Bristol to start music college. This gave me the spark of life I needed and reignited the passion in me. I had been a keen songwriter since the age of 11 and was getting more confident in my abilities as a vocalist, so I decided to take the plunge.<br><br>During this time I worked at the Bristol O2 Academy which was an incredible experience but also very tiring on top of college. This led me down a route of bartending for the next 5 or so years before I decided it was time to move onto greater things. This course was then suggested to me by my brother in law who now actually works at Mayden. It must've been a good sales pitch because here I am! </p>

			<div class="about-interests">
				<h2>My Interests...</h2>
				<p>Music is without a doubt the main passion and outlet in my life. When I was 7 I was gripped by Heavy Metal music and have never looked back since. Even though my dad has played guitar all his life and was in many bands, it was actually Guitar Hero that convinced me to pick up a 6-string around the age of 10, although I wouldn't consider myself competent until I was about 19. I started a band about 3 years ago with someone I met at college and managed to recruit a couple more to join us about a year after that. We are now just finishing off our 6th song before we'll be ready to hit the stage!<br><br>I suppose my main other interest would be gaming as that occupies a lot of my free time, with my 2 favourite game series being Resident Evil and The Legend of Zelda. Finally I can add another passion to my rather short list and that creates my Holy Trinity: Music, Gaming and CODING! It's been a long time since I was learning this much and I must say it is rather satisfying.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="about-aspirations">
				<h2>My Aspirations...</h2>
				<p>Of course it would be a dream come true to be able to do music full-time, but my realistic goal is to at least get a couple of festival performances under my belt and to continue writing and performing for life as it's what gives me purpose and keeps me motivated! Having said this, I definitely see myself coding/developing for the foreseeable future.<br><br>Although I really don't have any idea about what I'd like to do after this course yet I'm very excited to learn more about what I'm good at and what I enjoy. This course definitely represents a big change in my life and I plan to move back to Bristol when I've settled into a job after this. I also plan on using what I learn here to create our own band website and make it stand out from the rest!</p>
