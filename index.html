				<p>
					Built an API using Express with Node that connects to an SQL database. It allows for
					stock management, providing routes to add, edit, delete and retrieve product data
					as well as manage customer orders.<br><br>The relational database allowed us to use a
					table which joins customers and their orders, minimising the need for repeated data. The API will
					add new customer data to the database but will re-use customer data for returning customers when
					adding an order. It will also automatically update current stock quantity when orders are made,
					giving reliable feedback on what stock is currently left to be sold.<br><br>
					When a new product is entered a unique SKU is generated which the product can be identified by.

			<div class="projectText">
				<p>
					Created a Minesweeper-esque JavaScript game where the user dictates the size of the game
					and how many lynx they wish to find in a randomly generated forest of snakes.<br><br>
					I utilised the powers of JavaScript to dynamically render the amount of lives a user would have
					before starting the game, based on how many lynx they wish to find.<br><br>Used a modal which
					was set as hidden in CSS by default. It's triggered to display through JS when the game ends
					with the modal message being set dependent on a win or loss. Also set a default error
					message on the modal as a preventative measure against bugs, in case there happens to be an issue
					with setting the win/loss message.

				<p>
					Utilised OOP within PHP, as well as the hydrator design pattern to retrieve muppets and
					their stats to display on the front-end.<br><br>I worked on multiple tasks across the project such
					as the 'more details' feature on each muppet which retrieved a single entity from the database
					to display on a new page. Also worked on error handling for this to make sure users couldn't put
					an incorrect ID directly into the URL without being sent back with a custom error.<br><br>
					Made use of mocking in unit tests to decouple dependencies that certain methods had.<br><br>
					Sanitised and validated user input for partial search queries to the DB.

				<p>
					Built upon a legacy codebase using OOP & JavaScript with Slim. Followed the MVC design pattern in place
					and adhered to SOLID principles.<br><br>Found a pattern for a known bug in order to narrow down the
					cause and fix it. Also went about adding lock functionality to prevent deletion of applicant
					stages. I edited pre-existing Bootstrap classes for this page to incorporate lock icons and
					neaten the layout.<br><br>jQuery was prominent, so I had to learn more jQuery on the fly to fit with
					existing code. Was also introduced to Continuous Integration checks when pushing to GitHub.

					Rebuilt the Academy aptitude test in React, harnessing JavaScript to dynamically render
					pages with reusable components.<br><br>Working in 3 teams of 8, communication and sufficient sprint
					planning was paramount to our success. I optimised the codebase from the start to minimise
					technical debt. Also fetched correct answers from a RESTful API to compare with user answers
					that were captured in application state.
