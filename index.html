		<h1>iO Academy Portal (Legacy Codebase)</h1>
		<div class="project">
			<div>
				<img class="projectImage" src="assets/ioPortalScreenshotCompressed.png" alt="The daily commute" />
			</div>
			<p>
				Built upon a legacy codebase using Slim, following the MVC design pattern in place. Found a
				pattern to a known bug to narrow down the cause and fix it. <br><br> I went about
				adding lock functionality to prevent deletion of applicant stages. I edited pre-existing
				Bootstrap classes for this page to incorporate lock icons and neaten the layout. jQuery was
				prominent, so I had to learn more jQuery on the fly to fit with existing code.

		<h1>Snakesweeper</h1>
		<div class="project">
			<div>
				<img class="projectImage" src="assets/snakesweeperScreenshotCompressed.png" alt="The daily commute" />
			</div>
			<p>
				Created a Minesweeper-esque JavaScript game where the user dictates the size of the game
				and how many lynx they wish to find in a randomly generated forest of snakes.<br><br>
				I utilised the unique powers of JS to dynamically render the amount of lives a user would have
				before starting the game, based on how many lynx they wish to find.<br><br>Also used a modal which
				was set as hidden in CSS by default, which is triggered to display through JS when the game ends
				with the modal message being set differently dependent on a win or loss. Also set a default error
				message on the modal as a preventative measure against bugs, in case there happens to be an issue
				with setting the win/loss message.

		<div class="project">
			<div>
				<img class="projectImage" src="assets/aptitudeScreenshot.png" alt="Question view page from the iO Academy aptitude test" />
			</div>
			<p>
				Rebuilt the Academy aptitude test in React, harnessing JavaScript to dynamically render
				pages with reusable components. Working in 3 teams of 8, communication and sufficient sprint
				planning was paramount to our success. I optimised the codebase from the start to minimise
				technical debt. Also fetched correct answers from a RESTful API to compare with user answers.

		<h1>Muppets Collection</h1>
		<div class="project">
			<div>
				<img class="projectImage" src="assets/muppetScreenshot-min.png" alt="Muppet app index page" />
			</div>
			<p>
				Utilised OOP within PHP, as well as the hydrator design pattern to retrieve muppets and
				their stats to display on the front-end. I worked on multiple tasks across the project such
				as the 'more details' feature on each muppet which retrieved a single entity from the database
				to display on a new page. Worked on error handling to make sure users couldn't put an incorrect
				ID directly into the URL without being sent back with a custom error. Made use of mocking in
				unit tests to decouple dependencies that certain methods had. Also sanitised and validated
				user input for partial search queries to the DB.
