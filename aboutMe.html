                <h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
                <p>
                    My vast journey through this corporeal dimension led me to a top 10 global coding bootcamp with
                    iO Academy. I've applied myself across the full stack, mainly using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP among
                    a selection of frameworks and libraries like React, Bootstrap, Slim and SCSS. I've already adopted a
                    multitude of crucial coding conventions and habits in the form of design patterns and coding principles.
                    This has proven to be an important catalyst in my dev development.<br><br>I've been lucky to work in
                    a great team of 8 at the Academy and have participated in pair programming with all of them. I've also
                    been involved in sprint planning sessions as a whole dev team. I'm a certified Scrum Master through the
                    Scrum Alliance, and I was Scrum Master for the Academy Portal project, but have applied agile
                    methodologies to every team project I've participated in.

                <p>
                    The Holy trinity in The Church of Milo is simple: Music, Gaming and CODING!<br><br>
                    For most of my life I've been obsessed with music and have always been enthralled by the
                    creative process. I'm constantly looking to create something new and just love to set myself
                    a challenge or try to approach writing differently. One thing I've learned while coding
                    is that I have the same mentality here.<br><br>I have really loved experimenting with different
                    ways of solving problems and figuring out the limitations of each approach. I really do get a
                    kick out of improving my code, and take great pride in making my work neat, dynamic and DRY.

        <div class="about-aspirations">
            <div class="about-aspirations-text">
                <h2>My Aspirations...</h2>
                <p>
                    Although I'm naturally more suited to working in the back-end, I have loved seeing the connection between
                    client and server and find linking it all together very satisfying. The prospect of furthering my skills
                    across the full stack really excites me, and I've never been one to shy away from trying something new.
                    As long as I'm somewhere that sets healthy habits, takes pride in their work and pushes me to improve
                    then I'll be very content.<br><br>
                    As it stands, the world of coding is an ocean of possibilities, and I want to expose myself to as much of
                    it as I can to really hone in on what it is I excel at and enjoy the most.
