        <h2>The Story So Far...</h2>
        <p>
            My vast journey through this corporeal dimension led me to a top 10 global coding bootcamp with
            iO Academy. I've applied myself across the full stack, mainly using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP among
            a selection of frameworks and libraries like React, Bootstrap, Slim and SCSS. I've already adopted a
            multitude of crucial coding conventions and habits.<br><br>

        <h2>My Interests...</h2>
        <p>
            The Holy trinity of The Church of Milo is simple: Music, Gaming and CODING!<br><br>
            I currently have a keen interest in back-end development and take great pride in making my
            code neat, dynamic and DRY.
        </p>

    <div class="about-aspirations">
        <h2>My Aspirations...</h2>
        <p>
            Although I'm naturally more suited to working in the back-end, I have loved seeing the connection between
            client and server and find linking it all together very satisfying. The prospect of furthering my skills
            across the full stack really excites me, and I've never been one to shy away from trying something new.
            As long as I'm somewhere that sets healthy habits, takes pride in their work and pushes me to improve
            then I'll be very content.<br><br>
            As it stands, the world of coding is an ocean of possibilities, and I want to expose myself to as much of
            it as I can to really hone in on what it is I excel at and enjoy the most.
